# testmynids.org PCAP's
A website and framework for testing NIDS detection

## PCAP or it didn't happen!

One of the features that is made available from *tmNIDS* is the download and replay of PCAP's *(network packet captures)*. This folder will host all captures that are used in the tests, allowing you to see exactly what the test is doing. All the captures available under this project were publicly available and full credit to its author is given in each folder.
